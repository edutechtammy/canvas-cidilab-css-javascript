<!--   Based on the Cidi Labs DesignPLUS tools for Canvas, the Ordering Activity is an interactive element designed to boost student engagement and facilitate active learning directly within Canvas pages. 
Here is a description of the Cidi Labs Ordering Activity:
- Functionality: It allows instructors to create interactive, drag-and-drop activities where students must arrange items into a correct, specific order.
- Purpose: These activities are used to test knowledge, aid in memorization, or guide students through sequential processes, such as steps in a scientific method, historical timelines, or hierarchical structures.
- Accessibility & Implementation: These, like other DesignPLUS interactive elements, are designed to be accessible to all users. They are implemented via JavaScript within the Canvas Rich Content Editor (RCE).
- Part of DesignPLUS: The Ordering Activity is part of the broader suite of Design Tools (DesignPLUS) that allow instructors to add interactivity, such as accordion folders, tabs, and flashcards, without needing to write custom code. 
These tools are accessed via the "spaceship" icon in the Canvas content editor.    
- The default CidiLabs Order Items template has had styles added to bring in a TSTC theme look with Texas Blue background and red border around the order items.
