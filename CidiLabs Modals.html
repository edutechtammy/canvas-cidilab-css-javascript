<!--  Cidilabs modals: Cidi Labs (DesignPLUS) modals are interactive, pop-up dialog boxes designed for the Canvas Learning Management System that allow instructors to display additional information or collect data without leaving the main page. These modals are part of the DesignPLUS toolset, which enables the creation of highly customized, engaging, and accessible course content without requiring advanced HTML or CSS skills. 
Key Features and Functionality
- Pop-up Display: Modals act as a "lightbox" or popup, displaying content (such as images, text, or videos) that overlays the main content and darkens the background, forcing focus.
- Interaction-Driven: Modals require direct user interaction to be closed or dismissed.
- Implementation: They are typically configured by adding content into a specific gray area in the Design Tools editor, often positioned after an element like a paragraph or list that acts as the trigger.
- Functionality: They rely on JavaScript to operate, similar to other interactive elements like tabs, accordions, and revealers.
- Usage: They are used to enhance user experience by reducing clutter on the main page, providing additional resources, or creating "Quick Checks" for learners. 
These tools are part of the broader DesignPLUS suite, which includes the Sidebar for content editing, the Multi-Tool for course management, and various accessibility tools.    -->
