<!--  
  This is very similar to the common "Multiple Choice" question type, but instead of selecting a single answer from a list, students are required to select all correct answers from a list of options. This format is useful for questions where more than one answer may be valid, promoting critical thinking and comprehensive understanding of the material.

  This activity is currently a beta item, so not a lot of information is out on it yet.

 Customizations are made to the default CidiLabs Select All template to align with TSTC branding, including a Texas Blue background and red borders around the selectable items.
